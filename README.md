hi, i'm rajan and i build tech to solve fundamental problems with the most meaningful impact on those close and afar. 

i am currently studying Software Engineering at the University of Waterloo. previously, i have worked in startups and global organzations to bring accessible and meaningful technology to thousands of students, engineers and individuals.

currently, i am building [Portal](https://wearportal.co): the most immersive way to search through your memories.

recently, i built [Shapeshift](https://shapeshift.space): novel math + machine learning algorithms to optimize earthquake resistant buildings. i'm currently in the process of open sourcing its algorithms.

you can view my work at [rajan.sh](https://rajan.sh), accurate as of December 2023. reach out on [twitter](https://twitter.com/_rajanagarwal) to meet up, IRL or online!
